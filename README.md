# Project Title

This is a basic rock paper and scissors implementation in a Kotlin application. I chose to not spend time on the design part and to give only some examples of tests. I tried to make the app easily to extend.

### Installing

You can build and run directly the app on an emulator via Android Studio :
Run -> Run app

You can also build the apk file and install it or your device
Build -> Build apk, then open the file on your Android phone

## Running the tests

There are some example tests.

### Tests

We check if each hand wins against the desired hand.

### Android tests

Two examples of test : if user selection is disabled when computers are playing and check if we are displaying the good number of hands dynamically.

## Versioning

First POC of the application
